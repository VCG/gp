FRAME 1
Guided Proofreading of Automatic Segmentations for Connectomics


FRAME 2
In Connectomics, we create the wiring diagram of the mammalian brain


FRAME 3
For this, we take mice..


FRAME 4
..cut out their brain..


FRAME 5
..slice it up real thin..


FRAME 6
..and scan it with an electron microscop..


MOVIE SEQUENCE "BOBBY"
This results in very high resolution image slices showing neurons


FRAME 8 
These image slices are aligned to volumes..


FRAME 9
..and cells are automatically labeled.

Unfortunately, this automatic labeling is not perfect and introduces errors.


FRAME 10
For instance, if we zoom in here...


FRAME 11
..We see labels..


FRAME 12
..with indicated errors..


FRAME 13
The cell membranes here..


FRAME 14
..should actually produce a labeling like this.


FRAME 15
So how can we get from the wrong labeling on the left to the correct labeling on the right?


FRAME 16
And the answer is: Proofreading by humans


MOVIE SEQUENCE "DOJO"
This can be done interactively...

...using semi-automatic methods...

...but is tedious and takes a very long time..


FRAME 18
With our Guided Proofreading approach...

...a classifier finds errors automatically


FRAME 19
...and suggests corrections to the proofreader


MOVIE SEQUENCE "GP"

Here we see the guided proofreading system in action..

..Our system presents potential errors and and their corrections to the user..

..and the user chooses to accept or reject them via one click..

..For demonstration purposes, we show the improvement of variation of information after each correction in the bottom left. This is measured as part of our forced choice user experiment as described in the paper.

..Using guided proofreading, novices are able to correct automatic segmentations 7.5 times faster than interactively.

Our research and findings are available as free and open source.

Thank you very much.
