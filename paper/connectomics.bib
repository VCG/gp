 ABSTRACT={To stimulate progress in automating the reconstruction of neural circuits, we organized the first international challenge on 2D segmentation of electron microscopic (EM) images of the brain. Participants submitted boundary maps predicted for a test set of images, and were scored based on their agreement with a consensus of human expert annotations. The winning team had no prior experience with EM images, and employed a convolutional network. This “deep learning” approach has since become accepted as a standard for segmentation of EM images. The challenge has continued to accept submissions, and the best so far has resulted from cooperation between two teams. The challenge has probably saturated, as algorithms cannot progress beyond limits set by ambiguities inherent in 2D scoring and the size of the test dataset. Retrospective evaluation of the challenge scoring system reveals that it was not sufficiently robust to variations in the widths of neurite borders. We propose a solution to this problem, which should be useful for a future 3D segmentation challenge.}

Despite rapid advances in computing and imaging technology, current digital pathology systems have limited performance with respect to remote viewing of whole slide images on desktop or mobile computing devices. In this paper we present a novel digital pathology client–server system that supports collaborative viewing of multi-plane whole slide images over standard networks using multi-touch-enabled clients. Our system is built upon a standard HTTP web server and a MySQL database to allow multiple clients to exchange image and metadata concurrently. We introduce a domain-specific image-stack compression method that leverages real-time hardware decoding on mobile devices. It adaptively encodes image stacks in a decorrelated colour space to achieve extremely low bitrates (0.8 bpp) with very low loss of image quality. We evaluate the image quality of our compression method and the performance of our system for diagnosis with an in-depth user study.},

ABSTRACT={It's no secret that the increases in resolution possible with modern imaging equipment has led to an explosion in data. This increase is not always something that is easy to deal with, especially in studies that involve multiple modalities and sites. University and research networks while continually improving still do not allow those in the neuroinformatics field to seamlessly share multi-terrabye images. This leads to the problem in multi-site studies and often in smaller projects in which no one is sure where or how to access the current version of all the data without having to download TB's of data, make a small change and then upload again. This problem is not unique to the neuroimaging field and as such we have endeavoured to make use of techniques from the very closely related field of GIS (Graphical Information Systems) in this project. There has been some work done in this area, most notably with the web interfaces of the Allen Brain atlas and CATMAID. Both of these however are primarilly written for the viewing of multiple 2D images, typically of histology. TissueStack is an Open Source project that is currently available on GitHub ( http://github.com/NIF-au/TissueStack ) and at the time of this abstract is in alpha release phase for comment. Its purpose is to allow researchers to view multi-TB imaging datasets online vai an interface style that most people are familiar with (online mapping) at reasonable speed. The application uses HTML5 Canvas elements and thus will work equally well on mobile devices (tablets, phones, etc). The current proof of concept can be viewed at http://www.imaging.org.au/tissuestack and is displaying a 850MB 30um c57/bl mouse model. The application generates multi-scale tiled images from an input dataset in order to optimise viewing speed for a given network connection. Data input formats currently include MINC, NiFTI and OpenSlide formats. Future versions of the application will allow the federation of data from multiple sites and the overlay of pre-aligned muti-modality data such Histology and MRI.

ABSTRACT={WebGL is recent technology that exposes a computer?s GPU to a browser, and allows for the native generation of rich three dimensional graphics [1]. Compatible web browsers can offer a graphical experience comparable to more traditional stand-alone programs. As such WebGL offers the potential of bringing the "web"? to neuroscience, and has great potential to accelerate and support scientific research. Cognisant of these possibilities, we present ?The X Toolkit? (XTK), the first JavaScript-based framework for visualizing and interacting with medical imaging data using WebGL. The toolkit is geared towards powerful scientific visualization and provides a simple API (a 3D DICOM volume can be fully manipulated with three lines of code). Previous neuroimaging visualization using WebGL has been focused on specific data sets and is not easily generalizable [2],[3]. On the other hand, several frameworks for general WebGL development exist [4], but require a deep understanding of low-level computer graphics programming. Inspired by both approaches, we designed the XTK API to hide low-level elements of WebGL from users and offer native support of established neuroimaging file formats, e.g. supported files can be placed onto a web server and instantly rendered. XTK supports: surface meshes in the Visualization Toolkit, Standard Tessellation, and Freesurfer formats; single-file DICOM volumes and label maps in NRRD and Freesurfer formats; tractography files in the Diffusion Toolkit format; as well as curvature overlays. XTK is optimized to enable fast data processing and high rendering frame rates. The engine uses caching and optimized loops as well as asynchronous loading. The Google Closure compiler is connected to a CDash infrastructure to monitor the build process and track tests on different browsers. XTK, the build and test system, and all libraries are open sourced and hosted at GitHub [5].  <br/> <br/>[1] WebGL Specification, Khronos Group 2012, http://www.khronos.org/webgl [2] Ginsburg D. et al., Realtime Visualization of the Connectome in the Browser using WebGL. 4th INCF Congress of Neuroinformatics 2011. doi: 10.3389/conf.fninf.2011.08.00095 [3] Kelc R., Zygote Body: A New Interactive 3-Dimensional Didactical Tool for Teaching Anatomy.

We address the challenges of image volume composition from individual, deformed images; of the reconstruction of neuronal arbors and annotation of synapses with fast manual and semi-automatic methods; and the management of large collections of both images and annotations.

abstract={We address the problem of automatic 3D segmentation of a stack of electron microscopy sections of brain tissue. Unlike previous efforts, where the reconstruction is usually done on a section-to-section basis, or by the agglomerative clustering of 2D segments, we leverage information from the entire volume to obtain a globally optimal 3D segmentation. To do this, we formulate the segmentation as the solution to a fusion problem. We first enumerate multiple possible 2D segmentations for each section in the stack, and a set of 3D links that may connect segments across consecutive sections. We then identify the fusion of segments and links that provide the most globally consistent segmentation of the stack. We show that this two-step approach of pre-enumeration and posterior fusion yields significant advantages and provides state-of-the-art reconstruction results. Finally, as part of this method, we also introduce a robust rotationally-invariant set of features that we use to learn and enumerate the above 2D segmentations. Our features outperform previous connectomic-specific descriptors without relying on a large set of heuristics or manually designed filter banks.},

    the data based on semantic as well as spatial relationships. Additionally,
    we present visualization techniques for the concurrent depiction
    of neurobiological volume data and geometric objects which aim to
    reduce visual clutter. The described system is the result of an ongoing

The complexity and size of this data makes human interpretation a labor-intensive task. To aid in the analysis, new segmentation techniques for identifying neurons in these feature rich datasets are required. This paper presents a method for neuron boundary detection and nonbranching process segmentation in electron microscopy images and visualizing them in three dimensions. It combines both automated segmentation techniques with a graphical user interface for correction of mistakes in the automated process. The automated process first uses machine learning and image processing techniques to identify neuron membranes that deliniate the cells in each two-dimensional section. To segment nonbranching processes, the cell regions in each two-dimensional section are connected in 3D using correlation of regions between sections. The combination of this method with a graphical user interface specially designed for this purpose, enables users to quickly segment cellular processes in large volumes.}},

Finding these shapes is a special case of image segmentation, which is laborious for humans and would ideally be performed by computers. New metrics properly quantify the performance of a computer algorithm using its disagreement with 'true' segmentations of example images. New machine learning methods search for segmentation algorithms that minimize such metrics. These advances have reduced computer errors dramatically. It should now be faster for a human to correct the remaining errors than to segment an image manually. Further reductions in human effort are expected, and crucial for finding connectomes more complex than that of Caenorhabditis elegans. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy (EM) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize effectively to arbitrary image types.}},

We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning, staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may appear dissimilar in consecutive sections.Results: We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of the first instar larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster consisting of 6885 images.Availability: This method is implemented as part of the open source software TrakEM2 (http://www.ini.uzh.ch/∼acardona/trakem2.html) and distributed through the Fiji project (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de).Contact: tomancak@mpi-cbg.de}},

Automated and semi-automated electron microscopy (EM) image analysis can be tremendously helpful for connectomics research. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic approach for intra-section segmentation and inter-section reconstruction of neurons using \{EM\} images. A hierarchical merge tree structure is built to represent multiple region hypotheses and supervised classification techniques are used to evaluate their potentials, based on which we resolve the merge tree with consistency constraints to acquire final intra-section segmentation. Then, we use a supervised learning based linking procedure for the inter-section neuron reconstruction. Also, we develop a semi-automatic method that utilizes the intermediate outputs of our automatic algorithm and achieves intra-segmentation with minimal user intervention. The experimental results show that our automatic method can achieve close-to-human intra-segmentation accuracy and state-of-the-art inter-section reconstruction accuracy. We also show that our semi-automatic method can further improve the intra-segmentation accuracy. "

 ABSTRACT={The aim in high-resolution connectomics is to reconstruct complete neuronal connectivity in a tissue. Currently, the only technology capable of resolving the smallest neuronal processes is electron microscopy (EM). Thus, a common approach to network reconstruction is to perform (error-prone) automatic segmentation of EM images, followed by manual proofreading by experts to fix errors. We have developed an algorithm and software library to not only improve the accuracy of the initial automatic segmentation, but also point out the image coordinates where it is likely to have made errors. Our software, called gala (graph-based active learning of agglomeration), improves the state of the art in agglomerative image segmentation. It is implemented in Python and makes extensive use of the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy, networkx, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and others). We present here the software architecture of the gala library, and discuss several designs that we consider would be generally useful for other segmentation packages. We also discuss the current limitations of the gala library and how we intend to address them.}

abstract = "Abstract We present a new graphical-model-based method for automatic and interactive segmentation of neuron structures from electron microscopy (EM) images. For automated reconstruction, our learning based model selects a collection of nodes from a hierarchical merging tree as the proposed segmentation. More specifically, this is achieved by training a conditional random field (CRF) whose underlying graph is the watershed merging tree. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction of the \{CRF\} is the output segmentation. Our results are comparable to the results of state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, both the inference and the training are very efficient as the graph is tree-structured. The problem of neuron segmentation requires extremely high segmentation quality. Therefore, proofreading, namely, interactively correcting mistakes of the automatic method, is a necessary module in the pipeline. Based on our efficient tree-structured inference algorithm, we develop an interactive segmentation framework which only selects locations where the model is uncertain for a user to proofread. The uncertainty is measured by the marginals of the graphical model. Only giving a limited number of choices makes the user interaction very efficient. Based on user corrections, our framework modifies the merging tree and thus improves the segmentation globally. "
